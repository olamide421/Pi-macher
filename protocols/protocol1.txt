A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of DrugX in Patients with Moderate to Severe Hypertension

1. Objectives
1.1 Primary Objective
To assess the efficacy of DrugX in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension after 12 weeks of treatment.
1.2 Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DrugX.
To assess the impact of DrugX on diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
To evaluate the effect of DrugX on quality of life.
2. Study Design
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
3. Study Population
Adult males and females, aged 40-75 years, diagnosed with moderate to severe hypertension.
4. Inclusion Criteria
Aged 40-75 years.
Diagnosed with moderate to severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg).
Stable medical condition.
5. Exclusion Criteria
Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Patients with secondary hypertension.
History of severe cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease.
6. Randomization and Blinding
Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either DrugX or placebo.
Investigators, participants, and study staff will be blinded to treatment allocation.
7. Intervention
DrugX group: DrugX 10mg orally once daily for 12 weeks.
Placebo group: Matching placebo orally once daily for 12 weeks.
8. Study Assessments
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
Change in SBP and DBP from baseline to Week 12.
Quality of life assessed using the Hypertension Quality of Life Questionnaire at baseline and Week 12.
8.2 Safety Assessments
Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events.
Laboratory assessments including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests.
9. Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as a factor and baseline SBP as a covariate.
Safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
10. Ethics and Regulatory Compliance
The trial will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.
The protocol, informed consent form, and any amendments will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval.
11. Time Frame
The total duration of the study will be approximately 18 months, including 6 months for patient recruitment, 12 weeks for treatment, and 3 months for data analysis and reporting.
