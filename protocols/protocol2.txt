A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Topical CreamZ in Patients with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis

1. Objectives
1.1 Primary Objective
To assess the efficacy of CreamZ in reducing the severity and symptoms of atopic dermatitis after 8 weeks of treatment.
1.2 Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CreamZ.
To assess the impact of CreamZ on the quality of life.
To explore the long-term efficacy and safety of CreamZ over 24 weeks.
2. Study Design
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
3. Study Population
Adult males and females, aged 18-65 years, with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.
4. Inclusion Criteria
Diagnosed with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score between 10 and 20 at baseline.
5. Exclusion Criteria
Known hypersensitivity to any component of CreamZ.
Current use of other topical or systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis.
6. Randomization and Blinding
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either CreamZ or placebo.
Investigators, participants, and study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment.
7. Intervention
CreamZ group: Apply CreamZ topically twice daily for 8 weeks.
Placebo group: Apply matching placebo cream topically twice daily for 8 weeks.
8. Study Assessments
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
Change in EASI score from baseline to Week 8.
Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score at baseline and Week 8.
8.2 Safety Assessments
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
Local tolerability assessments.
9. Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using ANCOVA, with baseline EASI score as a covariate.
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.
10. Ethics and Regulatory Compliance
The trial will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.
All documents will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval.
11. Time Frame
Total duration of 16 months: 6 months for recruitment, 8 weeks of treatment, and 9 months for follow-up and data analysis.
