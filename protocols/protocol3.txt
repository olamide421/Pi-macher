A Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of DrugY in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

1. Objectives
1.1 Primary Objective
To assess the efficacy of DrugY in improving overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced NSCLC.
1.2 Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with DrugY.
To assess the safety and tolerability of DrugY in this patient population.
To examine the quality of life in patients receiving DrugY.
2. Study Design
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
3. Study Population
Adult males and females, aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with stage IIIb/IV NSCLC.
4. Inclusion Criteria
Confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIb/IV NSCLC.
ECOG performance status of 0-1.
Adequate organ function.
5. Exclusion Criteria
Previous treatment with similar class of drugs as DrugY in the past 6 months.
Presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases.
Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions.
6. Randomization and Blinding
Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either DrugY or placebo.
Participants, investigators, and trial staff will be blinded to treatment assignment.
7. Intervention
DrugY group: DrugY 100mg orally once daily until disease progression.
Placebo group: Matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression.
8. Study Assessments
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
OS and PFS will be evaluated through periodic imaging.
Quality of life assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and at regular intervals.
8.2 Safety Assessments
Adverse events will be monitored and categorized according to CTCAE v5.0.
Regular monitoring of laboratory parameters.
9. Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint (OS) will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.
Safety data will be summarized descriptively.
10. Ethics and Regulatory Compliance
The study will adhere to the Declaration of Helsinki, GCP guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.
Approval will be sought from the relevant IRBs.
11. Time Frame
Estimated study duration is 24 months, including 12 months for recruitment, 6 months for follow-up, and 6 months for data analysis and reporting.
