This project matches **clinical trial protocols** with the most suitable **Principal Investigators (PIs)** by analyzing their resumes and trial documents.   Instead of manually scanning long resumes and protocols, this system uses **NLP similarity algorithms** to recommend the **top-2 investigators** for a given trial protocol.
